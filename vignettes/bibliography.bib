  abstract = {Summary             Small area estimation is a research area in official and survey statistics of great practical relevance for national statistical institutes and related organizations. Despite rapid developments in methodology and software, researchers and users would benefit from having practical guidelines for the process of small area estimation. We propose a general framework for the production of small area statistics that is governed by the principle of parsimony and is based on three broadly defined stages, namely specification, analysis and adaptation, and evaluation. Emphasis is given to the interaction between a user of small area statistics and the statistician in specifying the target geography and parameters in the light of the available data. Model-free and model-dependent methods are described with a focus on model selection and testing, model diagnostics and adaptations such as use of data transformations. Uncertainty measures and the use of model and design-based simulations for method evaluation are also at the centre of the paper. We illustrate the application of the proposed framework by using real data for the estimation of non-linear deprivation indicators. Linear statistics, e.g. averages, are included as special cases of the general framework.},

  abstract = {Estimates of poverty are an important input into policy formulation in developing countries. The accurate measurement of poverty rates is therefore a first-order problem for development policy. This paper shows that combining satellite imagery with household surveys can improve the precision and accuracy of estimated poverty rates in Mexican municipalities, a level at which the survey is not considered representative. It also shows that a household-level model outperforms other common small area estimation methods. However, poverty estimates in 2015 derived from geospatial data remain less accurate than 2010 estimates derived from household census data. These results indicate that the incorporation of household survey data and widely available satellite imagery can improve on existing poverty estimates in developing countries when census data are old or when patterns of poverty are changing rapidly, even for small subgroups.},

  abstract = {The authors propose to estimate nonlinear small area population parameters by using the empirical Bayes (best) method, based on a nested error model. They focus on poverty indicators as particular nonlinear parameters of interest, but the proposed methodology is applicable to general nonlinear parameters. They use a parametric bootstrap method to estimate the mean squared error of the empirical best estimators. They also study small sample properties of these estimators by model-based and design-based simulation studies. Results show large reductions in mean squared error relative to direct area-specific estimators and other estimators obtained by “simulated” censuses. The authors also apply the proposed method to estimate poverty incidences and poverty gaps in Spanish provinces by gender with mean squared errors estimated by the mentioned parametric bootstrap method. For the Spanish data, results show a significant reduction in coefficient of variation of the proposed empirical best estimators over direct estimators for practically all domains.

  abstract = {This paper evaluates the benefits of combining household surveys with satellite and other geospatial data to generate small area estimates of non-monetary poverty. Using data from Tanzania and Sri Lanka and applying a household-level empirical best (EB) predictor mixed model, we find that combining survey data with geospatial data significantly improves both the precision and accuracy of our non-monetary poverty estimates. While the EB predictor model moderately underestimates standard errors of those point estimates, coverage rates are similar to standard survey-based standard errors that assume independent outcomes across clusters.}
